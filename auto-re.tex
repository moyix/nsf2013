Software, including common examples such as commercial applications or
embedded device firmware, is often delivered as closed-source binaries.  While
prior academic work has examined how to automatically discover vulnerabilities
in binary software, and even how to automatically craft exploits for these
vulnerabilities, answering basic security-relevant questions about
closed-source software remains difficult.  For instance, ideally one would like to
know whether software contains malicious functionality; whether it contains
obfuscated code or protocols indicative of malicious behavior; what security
properties does this software intend to provide; and, whether one can
recognize when software is deviating from normal, intended behavior at
runtime.

This project aims to provide algorithms and tools for answering these questions.
Leveraging prior work on emulator-based dynamic analyses, we propose techniques
for scaling this high-fidelity analysis to capture and extract whole-system
behavior in the context of embedded device firmware.  Using a combination of
dynamic execution traces collected from this analysis platform and binary code
analysis techniques, we propose techniques for automated structural analysis of
closed-source software, decomposing system and user-level programs into logical
modules through inference of high-level semantic behavior.  This decomposition
provides as output an automatically learned description of the interfaces and
information flows between each module at a sub-program granularity.

In addition to a \emph{structural} understanding of software, a reverse
engineering task may require a \emph{semantic} understanding as well. Building
on emulation-based dynamic analysis and structural decomposition as a
foundation, we will develop automated techniques for producing high-level
summaries of whole system executions and software components, allowing reverse
engineers to quickly get human-readable labels like ``encryption'' or ``file
parsing'' for modules and functions.

Finally, as an application of our framework for whole-system understanding, we
propose techniques for automating the reverse engineering of encrypted network
protocols commonly used by malware to obfuscate their communication with
command-and-control servers.

\todo[inline]{Expand introduction.}

\paragraph{Intellectual Merit.} Reverse engineering is a critical capability
for understanding and responding to software-borne threats, and can enable
deep system understanding towards automated hardening of existing
closed-source platforms.  However, reverse engineering currently entails the training
of highly-skilled security professionals, as well as significant manual
effort, both processes that do not scale to meet the current needs of industry
and government.  The automated techniques and tools we will develop in the
course of this research will lay the groundwork for meeting this need, as well
as enable new automatic hardening and threat response capabilities.

\paragraph{Broader Impacts.} The research proposed herein will have a
significant impact outside of the security research community.  We will
incorporate the research findings of our program into our undergraduate and
graduate teaching curricula, as well as in extracurricular educational efforts
such as Capture-the-Flag that have broad outreach in the greater Boston and
Atlanta metropolitan areas.  The close ties to industry that the collective
PIs possess will facilitate transitioning the research into practical
defensive tools that can be deployed into real-world systems and networks. As
a result, the program will have broad impact on both the training of
next-generation cybersecurity professionals as well as the advancement of
defensive tool capabilities in operational environments.

When analyzing software, it is often uncommon to have access to the source
code of the program of interest.  Manually finding vulnerabilities or
malicious behavior in binary programs is time-consuming, error-prone, and
typically requires allocating highly-experienced reverse engineers to the
task. Therefore, it is desirable to have precise and scalable program analyses
of native binary executables to discover vulnerabilities or malicious
components of these programs, render benign applications more resilient to
known classes of attack, and to deep insight into a system's runtime state.
Systems like \dynamicsys provide a solid basis for developing analyses of this
sort.

Given the capability to perform precise static and dynamic data-flow analysis
on binaries, it becomes possible to answer higher-level questions such as:
\begin{inparaenum}[i)]
    \item what are the distinct modules that comprise the program or system,
    \item what are the interfaces that these modules expose to their environment,
    \item what are the information flows between these modules, and
    \item can we characterize the normal behavior of a system in terms of this higher
        level of abstraction and detect deviations from expected behavior?
\end{inparaenum}

We propose the development of an advanced, automated binary program analysis
platform that aims to automatically answer these questions.  Specifically, our
platform leverages \dynamicsys to identify the modules that comprise a set of
binary programs, the interfaces they expose, and characterize their structure
and expected behavior.  The platform leverages \dynamicsys and uses a
combination of static and dynamic analyses to automatically infer the
high-level structure and interfaces of large-scale programs for which only the
binary -- and the ability to execute it -- is given.  A precise and efficient
static analysis allows the platform to construct reliable control-flow graphs
(CFGs) of the programs under test.  Whole-system emulation is then used to
perform fine-grained, instruction-level, dynamic analysis.  The resulting
execution traces allow the platform to perform advanced data-flow analyses
that refine the statically-derived CFG.  Using these program analyses, we will
then extract behavioral models of the program under test that can be compared
to a
\emph{minimal} specification of its expected behavior.  This capability will
allow our platform to automatically decompose a set of binary executables into
their constituent logical modules, as well as identify both direct and
indirect communication channels with other modules and the external
environment.

The models extracted from a binary program under analysis will then be used as
input to a runtime monitoring component.  This monitor will periodically
compare the execution state of the program to invariants encoded in the model,
allowing for the efficient detection of abnormal deviations from expected
behavior.  Additionally, the higher-level characterization of program behavior
learned in the previous phase will allow for better explanatory power in the
reports generated by the monitor, leading to increased insight into whole
system behavior on the part of system operators.

The envisioned architecture of our analysis platform is depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:decomposition-arch}.  The approach consists of two logical
phases.  In the first, the analysis components are applied to a replica of a
deployed system within an isolated, emulated environment.  From these
analyses, a model of high-level program structure and legitimate behavior is
extracted.  This model is then used in the second phase, where a secure
runtime component checks the execution of the deployed system against the
model.  Any deviations from this model are indicated in the form of high-level
alerts to system operators.

In the following, we elaborate upon each of the components of our system for
system taint analysis and monitoring.

    legitimate behavior that is then used to monitor the state of the
    deployed system.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamic Analysis Engine}

The dynamic analysis engine performs its analysis inside of a high-fidelity
emulated environment based on the \dynamicsys system.  The system monitors the
activity of programs under test during runtime, and has full visibility into
the state of the entire machine at an instruction-level granularity.  This
precision complements the strengths of static analyses; since dynamic analysis
operates over concrete values, the technique has the significant advantage
that it can easily handle obfuscated, self-modifying, and concurrent code.  We
refer the reader to the discussion on \dynamicsys in
Section~\ref{sec:research:firmware} for more details.

In addition to operation over concrete values, we additionally incorporate
dynamic symbolic execution over these traces.  Dynamic symbolic execution
substitutes symbolic values for inputs to individual modules, allowing for the
identification of new inputs that can be provided to the program under test in
order to explore previously uncovered code.  This capability relies upon the
identification of module boundaries and interfaces, which we describe in
Section~\ref{sec:research:structure:modules}.

The output of the dynamic analysis engine is a set of execution traces
augmented with data flow information.  These traces completely describe the
evolution of the state of the program under test with respect to the test
inputs, its interaction with the environment, and the propagation of data
through the system.

\subsection{Static Analysis Engine}

The static analysis engine provides a precise and scalable set of analyses
that operate directly on binary program executables, without the need for
source code.  Incorporating a robust static analysis component allows our
platform to achieve high coverage of program behaviors over possible inputs
without having to actually exercise the program under test on those inputs.
However, static analysis has well-known deficiencies -- especially with
respect to binary executables -- that are important to address.

To that end, we will leverage our prior work on static binary analysis. In
doing so, our platform will be based upon a strong foundation of analyses that
can handle imprecision at multiple levels, including both disassembly and
control flow.

\paragraph{Robust disassembly.} A well-known challenge for binary static
analysis is the difficulty of achieving full coverage of the code contained in
an executable image. Our prior work has studied techniques for improving the
robustness of binary disassembly, and we intend to leverage both symbolic
execution and statistical analysis to that end~\cite{kruegel:sec2004:disasm}.
The use of a symbolic execution engine allows our disassembler to handle many
computed jumps that would otherwise be difficult to resolve statically.

Our work also incorporates statistical techniques to probabilistically
identify likely code regions in binary executables.  An example of this is to
collect, \emph{a priori}, digram probabilities for pairs of instructions from
a corpus of known benign programs.  Then, this can be used during disassembly
to probabilistically identify code regions, or reduce the imprecision
introduced by a (overly-conservative) widened symbolic jump target.

Malicious code also often utilizes obfuscation techniques to hinder static
analysis, such as overlapping instruction sequences as seen in variable length
ISAs such as ix86, or switching between multiple supported ISAs as in the case
of ARM and the Thumb family of instruction sets.  We will develop techniques
to handle these classes of obfuscation.

\paragraph{Control-flow subgraph matching.} One capability that is
particularly useful in several contexts relating to binary static analysis is
fuzzy control-flow subgraph matching.  Our prior work has demonstrated its
utility when performing efficient online detection of polymorphic worm
propagation on the network~\cite{kruegel:raid2005:worm}. We anticipate that
this capability will be useful in achieving the goal of module identification
and behavioral characterization.

Our technique for fuzzy control-flow subgraph matching takes two binary CFGs
as input, where graph nodes and edges represent basic blocks and control flow
transfers, respectively.  The algorithm colors the graph based on the
semantics of instructions contained in each basic block, extracts
$k$-subgraphs for small values of $k$ by computing a spanning tree, and then
performs fast subgraph matching to determine the overlap between $k$-subgraphs
from each CFG. By applying abstraction and decomposing the CFGs into
subgraphs, our matching technique is able to efficiently discover
semantically-similar CFGs.  We anticipate that this matching technique can
serve as a robust base upon which to enable module identification.

\subsection{Analysis Capabilities}
\label{sec:research:structure:modules}

The combination of our proposed static and dynamic analyses for binary
programs will enable several key capabilities: automated module
identification, behavioral characterization, interface enumeration, and
runtime monitoring.

\paragraph{Module identification and characterization.} Our composition of
program analyses will allow our platform to automatically identify the
constituent modules of a binary set of programs under test and, in conjunction
with limited \emph{a priori} domain knowledge of the program, classify each
module according to its function.  Module identification will proceed by
iterating between two distinct phases. First, a robust static disassembly and
context-sensitive control-flow analysis will allow our platform to obtain an
initial control-flow graph (CFG) of the program. During this phase,
domain-specific knowledge can be leveraged to statically classify subgraphs of
the CFG as belonging to particular modules -- e.g., by recognizing the
definition and use of interrupt vectors specific to a particular machine
architecture.

During the second phase, this initial static model will be refined by
monitoring the runtime behavior of the program under test.  Ambiguities
resulting from natural limits on the precision of static analysis can be
resolved by observing program behavior over concrete inputs and applying
dynamic symbolic execution over the resulting traces.  For instance,
incomplete coverage of the binary program under test can be improved by
resolving the targets of statically unknown indirect control flow transfers
during the dynamic analysis phase.  The dynamic trace analysis will be
combined with judicious application of novel program invariant inference
techniques~\cite{ernst:2009:daikon,csallner:icse2008:dysy,krka:icsa2010:inference}.
By associating code structure with state invariants at critical program
points, our platform will be capable of recognizing many common program design
patterns of interest.

Iterating between these two phases will allow the platform to identify control
flow patterns that correspond to high-level specifications of expected
behavior defined \emph{a priori} for one or more modules.  For instance, in
the case where a multitasking real-time operating system (RTOS) is being
analyzed, one would expect to observe a control transfer as a result of a
timer interrupt, followed by a deterministic loop over an array or list of
process descriptors, followed by the resumption of a selected thread of
control.  Our platform will allow for the specification and matching of such
high-level patterns of control flows against real binaries and execution
traces.  In the case that concurrent execution of multiple modules is
encountered by the platform, domain-specific knowledge will be leveraged for
the particular machine architecture to isolate and extract traces for each
distinct thread of execution.

\paragraph{Invariant analysis.} Prior work on invariant analysis major
limitations that we aim to improve in our proposed work.  First, current
invariant invariant approaches are primarily limited to either predefined
templates~\cite{ernst:2009:daikon} or extraction of low-level invariants from
program code~\cite{csallner:icse2008:dysy}.  While extraction of low-level
invariants is a promising direction, we will develop techniques for inferring
high-level invariants over module behavior and inter-module communication in
the context of high-level module behavior summaries that are security-relevant
-- i.e., useful for enforcing security properties such as isolation between
   modules with different privilege levels or belonging to distinct security
   principals.

A second limitation of current invariant detection approaches is that they
require either source code, bytecode, or binary programs compiled with
debugging information.  In our work, we aim to extend invariant analysis to
cover binary programs for which we do not have access to such information.
This will require differential analysis of the memory of the program during
execution at selected program points.  In addition, we will define algorithms
to scope the differential program state analysis to the subset of memory that
can be accessed by the current region of code -- e.g., the currently executing
function.  Determining this memory subset will require incorporation of both
static and dynamic information.

Finally, we aim to address the restriction that current invariant analyses are
primarily limited to the form of pre- and post-conditions on function or
method invocations.  A major part of our work will include the identification
and application of invariants in a fine-grained manner, where we will select
critical points in the CFG using structural analysis to apply our invariants.
As an example, using this approach we aim to discover program points such as
loops over critical data structures, or switch tables that correspond to
individual protocol state handlers

\paragraph{Module interface enumeration.} Once a set of modules has been
identified from the combination of the statically-derived CFG and runtime
monitoring, the analysis platform will proceed to automatically identify the
interfaces exposed by each module.  This step will take into account
domain-specific knowledge regarding machine architecture -- e.g., to identify
the use of special instructions that allow for control transfers between
modules such as system call service invocations.  To enable richer semantic
understanding of not only the vectors for entering a module, but also the
types of data that accompanies these control transfers, the platform will
leverage a combination of static and dynamic data-flow analyses to
characterize the number and types of parameters for control transfers across
modules.  In cases where memory is shared between modules, points-to analyses
will be leveraged to characterize the data shared between modules and the sets
of modules that contain references to particular memory objects.  For
instance, returning to the example of an RTOS, our platform will be able to
identify well-known structures such as process lists or memory descriptors as
channels of information flow that serve as an \emph{implicit} interface
between logically-distinct modules.

\paragraph{Runtime monitoring.} The result of the previous phase will be a
high-level structural model of the system under test in the form of a
decomposition of independent models, a characterization of their function and
behavior, and execution state invariants at critical program points.  This
model will then be used by a runtime component that will monitor the execution
of the deployed system. The monitoring component will use dynamic state
introspection and will be protected from attacks against integrity using a
robust isolation mechanism. Introspection will occur at carefully selected
program points in order to balance behavioral coverage with performance
requirements.

Deviations from the model that are indicative of anomalous and potentially
malicious factors will be detected and reported.  Additionally, due to the
characterization analysis performed during model construction, reports will
contain high-level information concerning \emph{why} the observed behavior is
anomalous, leading to increased whole-system insight on the part of system
analysts and operators.

\subsection*{Synergistic Activities}

Dr.~William Robertson is an assistant professor of Computer Science at
Northeastern University in Boston, MA.  His research interests revolve around
the security of the web, mobile devices, and operating systems. He was
involved in both the California Top-to-Bottom-Review (TTBR) and the Ohio
EVEREST projects as a Red Team member.  In this capacity, he demonstrated that
electronic voting systems were potentially susceptible to large-scale attacks
that could exploit numerous vulnerabilities in the firmware and physical
security of the components of the voting system.  These findings led to
significant changes in public policy in both states with respect to electronic
voting, including restrictions or outright bans on the use of these systems.
He is also involved in Lastline, Inc., a startup focused on the detection of
advanced persistent threats and zero-day attacks that is based on the products
of his and his collaborators' research.

Dr.~Robertson also has extensive experience in organizing and participating in
Capture-the-Flag (CTF) exercises.  With Shellphish, a team composed of
UCSB-affiliated members, he won the 2005 edition of the DEFCON CTF
competition.  He was also instrumental in helping to organize the UCSB iCTF,
the largest distributed CTF competition, from its inception in 2003 to 2008.

Dr.~Robertson was the program co-chair of the 2013 USENIX Workshop on
Offensive Technologies (WOOT), co-located with USENIX Security.  He was the
chair of the 2012 Conference on the Detection of Intrusions and Malware \&
Vulnerability Assessment (DIMVA).  He has participated on the program
committees of a number of top-tier systems security venues, including IEEE
Security and Privacy, USENIX Security, and RAID.  He is also the author of
more than twenty peer-reviewed journal and conference papers in the area of
systems and network security.

\section*{Northeastern University}

Northeastern University is a private research university in Boston and a
leader in integrating classroom learning with real-world experience.
Northeastern has eight colleges and offers undergraduate majors in 65
departments. At the graduate level, the university offers more than 125
programs and awards masters, doctoral, and professional degrees.
Northeastern's 73-acre award winning campus is the home of more than 35
specialized research and education centers.  Northeastern has significant
depth in terms of faculty and research strengths in the areas of systems and
systems security. In 2010, Northeastern University received a \$12 million
gift from one of its alumni, George J.~Kostas, E'43, H'07, to build a secure,
state-of-the-art homeland security research facility on the university's
Burlington campus. The new George J.~Kostas Research Institute for Homeland
Security, a multi-story building, has been designed in accordance with US
government standards for secure facilities and gives Northeastern the capacity
and clearances to conduct secure research in a restricted environment. Within
the building, sensitive, interdisciplinary research takes place in areas
critical to national security, including cryptography, data security, systems
security, information assurance, detection of explosives, and energy
harvesting.  The College of Engineering and the College of Computer and
Information Science also have programs in cyber infrastructure protection,
networks, algorithms, and languages.

The environment at Northeastern University offers a unique opportunity for the
PIs to carry out this project.  The proposed research directions complement
well the existing strengths in multiple areas of computer science, including
networks (Guevara Noubir, Alan Mislove, Christo Wilson, and David Choffnes),
systems (Peter Desnoyers and Gene Cooperman), algorithms (Rajmohan Rajaraman),
formal methods (Pete Manolios and Thomas Wahl), and programming languages
(Matthias Felleisen, Mitch Wand, Olin Shivers).
